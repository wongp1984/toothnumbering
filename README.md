# Automatic Tooth Numbering in Bitewing Radiographs using Deep Learning

This repository contains the implementation codes for my master dissertatiob in Data Science. A novel stage-wise approach using YOLOv5 as object detector is adopted in detecting and identifying tooth numbers. Interested readers can refer to the [dissertation](https://github.com/wongp1984/toothnumbering/blob/main/Thesis_Extract.pdf) for the details of the project.
