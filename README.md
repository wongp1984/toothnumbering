# Automatic Tooth Numbering in Bitewing Radiographs using Deep Learning

This repository contains the implementation codes for my master thesis in Data Science. A stage-wise approach using YOLOv5 as object detector is adopted in detecting and identifying tooth numbers. Interested readers can refer to the thesis for the details of the project.
